TODO:
- [ ] Document the data interface to tell others how they should bind to them:
  - [ ] 2 positions + obstacle map and a direction out for Voldy
  - [ ] Calum should make his own state machine that can be then acted on within my lost state
  - [ ] Up to the other 2 how they want to implement that
- [ ] re-add obstacle awareness
- [ ] add rotation and optimisations for that (low priority ATM)
- [ ] add awareness of walls (generalised rule free(x,y) would be in place)
